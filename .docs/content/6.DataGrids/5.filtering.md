# Filtering

You can filter the data to display only the information you need. Some data fields cannot be filtered.

## Types

Different types of filters are available, depending on the field type. Each type has its own allowed operations. 

| Type | Equal | Not Equal | Greater Than | Greater or Equal | Less Than | Less or Equal | Contains | Not Contains | Start With | End With | Before | Before Or Equal | After | After Or Equal | Is |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| String | ✔ | ✔ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Numerical | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Status | ✔ | ✔ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Date | ✔ | ✔ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ❌ |
| Array | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✔ | ✔ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Boolean | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✔ |

## How filters work

Data are filtered through algorithmic conditions. Which means that you can merge filters with `AND` and `OR` conditions.

For example, if you create a filter:

```
SESSION_ID Start With "s" AND STATUS Equal to Closed OR SESSION_ID Equal to "my-session"
```

You will filter the data by the `Closed` sessions with an ID that start with "s", or the session with the ID "my-session".

Some operation cannot be applied twice in the same `AND` filter.

Example:
<br/>
`SESSION_ID Start With "s" AND SESSION_ID Start With "a"` will not work.
<br/>
`SESSION_ID Start With "s" OR SESSION_ID Start With "a"` will work.
<br/>
`SESSION_ID Contains "s" AND SESSION_ID Contains "a"` will work.
