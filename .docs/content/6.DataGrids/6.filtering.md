# Filtering

You can filter the data to display only the information you need. Some data fields cannot be filtered.

## Operators

Different types of filters are available, depending on the field type. Each type has its own allowed operations. 

| Type | Equal | Not Equal | Greater Than | Greater or Equal | Less Than | Less or Equal | Contains | Not Contains | Start With | End With | Before | Before Or Equal | After | After Or Equal | Is |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| String | ✔ | ✔ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Number | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Status | ✔ | ✔ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Date | ✔ | ✔ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ❌ |
| Array | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✔ | ✔ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Boolean | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✔ |

## How filters work

Data are filtered through algorithmic conditions. Which means that you can merge filters with `AND` and `OR` conditions.

### *Examples*

We have the following data:

```json
[
  { sessionId: "session-1", status: "Closed", ... },
  { sessionId: "session-2", status: "Running", ... },
  { sessionId: "my-session", status: "Running", ... },
  { sessionId: "another-session", status: "Closed", ... }
]
```

---
Let's apply the following filter:

```
sessionId Start With "s" AND status Equal to "Closed" OR sessionId Equal to "my-session"
```

The data will be filtered by the `Closed` sessions with an ID that start with "s", or the session with the ID "my-session".

In the end, we will receive the following data:

```json
[
  { sessionId: "session-1", status: "Closed" },
  { sessionId: "my-session", status: "Running" },
]
```
---
Let's try to apply another filter:
```
sessionId Start With "s" AND sessionId Start With "a"
```

The data will be filtered by the session that both start with "s" and "a". It does not make any sense, so we will receive an empty list of data.

We still want to list the sessions that start with "s" and "a". But we have to be carreful on how we build our conditions. Here, the problem is that a word cannot start by "a" and "s" at the same time. But it can start by "a" or "s". So, a correct way to say it would be: `list all the sessions that start with "s" OR "a"`.

So, our final filter would be:
```
sessionId Start With "s" OR sessionId Start With "a"
```

We will then receive:
```json
[
  { sessionId: "session-1", status: "Closed", ... },
  { sessionId: "session-2", status: "Running", ... },
  { sessionId: "another-session", status: "Closed", ... }
]
```

It is merely an example with the `Start With` filter. Other filters are concerned, so think carrefully before applying a filter !
