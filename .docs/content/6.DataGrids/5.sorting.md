# Sorting

As you will see, some columns are sortables, depending on their types and the displayed data.

To sort data by a column, simply click on the column. If the column is sortable, an arrow (⬇ for descending order or ⬆ for ascending order) should appear.

For more information on which column is sortable, take a look to the [Data](../7.Data/1.Applications.md) documentation.
