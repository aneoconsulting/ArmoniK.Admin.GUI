# Columns Types

A DataGrid Column is a data field. Every field has its own type, and is displayed in a certain way.

## Simple Columns

Simple Columns is a term that group columns of type `String`, `Number` and `Boolean`.

::alert{type="info"}
Simple Columns are **always sortable and filterable**.

## Link Columns

Link columns are generally `String` columns that have the possibility to redirect you to another data page. They either can:
- Redirect you to a datagrid, applying a filter.
<!--TODO: Inspection page-->
- Redirect you to a [inspection]() page.

## Duration Columns

Duration columns are displayed in hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds if needed.

::alert{type="info"}
Duration columns are **always sortable** but **not filterable**

## Object columns

Object Columns can be see as `JSON objects` or `arrays`. They are displayed as an **eye button**. By clicking on the eye, you will have a precised display of the object.

::alert{type="info"}
Objects are **not sortable** and **only arrays can be filtered**.

## Date columns

Depending on the displayed data, a date column can display its creation date, end date...

::alert{type="info"}
Dates are **always sortable and filterable**.

## Statuses

Some datagrid offer the possibility to display the status of one of the data. The status represent the current state of the displayed data, which will evolve during a run. 

::alert{type="info"}
Statuses are **always sortable and filterable**.

## Tasks by Statuses

They represent a field of the `Custom Data` object column. By adding a custom column, you can display a new column.

You can add, edit or delete a custom columns via the button `Manage Custom Columns` in the `Options` actions in the top right corner of the toolbar.

Actions columns provide a quick way to interact with data. Depending on the datagrid, you can copy the ID of the data, cancel a session, open grafana or seq...
