# Columns Types

A DataGrid Column is a data field. Every field has its own type, and is displayed in a certain way.

## Simple Columns

Simple Columns is a term that group columns of type `String`, `Number` and `Boolean`. They values are displayed as received.

::alert{type="info"}
Simple Columns are **always sortable and filterable**.
::

## Link Columns

Link columns are generally `String` columns that have the possibility to redirect you to another data page. They either can:
- Redirect you to a datagrid, applying a filter.
- Redirect you to a [inspection]() page.

::alert{type="info"}
Link Columns are **always sortable and filterable**.
::

## Duration Columns

Duration columns are displayed in hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds if needed.

::alert{type="info"}
Duration columns are **always sortable** but **not filterable**
::

## Object columns

Object Columns can be see as `JSON objects` or `arrays`. They are displayed as an **eye button**. By clicking on the eye, you will have a precised display of the object.

::alert{type="info"}
Objects are **not sortable** and **only arrays can be filtered**.
::

## Date columns

Depending on the displayed data, a date column can display its creation date, end date...

::alert{type="info"}
Dates are **always sortable and filterable**.
::

## Statuses

Some datagrid offer the possibility to display the status of one of the data. The status represent the current state of the displayed data, which will evolve during a run. 

::alert{type="info"}
Statuses are **always sortable and filterable**.
::

## Tasks by Statuses

::horizontal-area{left=80}
#left
This column is only available to [Applications](../5.Data/1.Applications.md), [Partitions](../5.Data/2.Partitions.md) and [Sessions](../7.Data/3.Sessions.md) Datagrids, and display the number of tasks grouped by one or more status.

The tasks of a session, application or partition will be grouped by their statuses in this column. A "Status Group" can group many statuses. Clicking on a group will redirect you to the [Tasks Datagrid](../7.Data/4.Tasks.md), filtered by the desired statuses.

You can edit the displayed statuses by clicking on the button next to `Tasks by Statuses` in the column header.

You then have the possibility to create a new `Statuses Group`, edit or delete one. You can also drag a status from a group to another.

::alert{type="info"}
Tasks by Statuses columns are **not filterable and sortable**.

## Custom Columns

Some data fields are not available in ArmoniK. Those fields are unique for each application and might contains important information about the run. Since they change from a user to another, the GUI cannot have them by default.

To display those data fields, you can use custom columns. Those columns will look for the data located in the `options.options` (displayed as the "Custom Data" column) field of a task or session.

The custom columns are available for [Sessions](../7.Data/3.Sessions.md) and [Tasks](../7.Data/4.Tasks.md) datagrids. They represent values that are not available by default in ArmoniK.

You can add, edit or delete a custom columns via the button `Manage Custom Columns` in the `Options` actions in the top right corner of the toolbar. You will then be able to indicate the field you want to add.

::alert{type="warning"}
When adding custom columns, be careful to name them correctly. They are case sensitive, so a misplaced capital letter may break a column, and no data will be displayed.
::

::alert{type="info"}
Custom Columns are **always filterable and sortable**
::

## Actions columns

Actions columns provide a quick way to interact with data. Depending on the datagrid, you can copy the ID of the data, cancel a session, open grafana or seq...

A more precise description of the available **datagrid actions** will be detailed in each datagrid page.
