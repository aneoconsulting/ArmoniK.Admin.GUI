# Pagination

Data are organised in tables through pages. They have a maximum number of items (applications, sessions, tasks...) they can display.
You can travel through the pages via the pagination panel, at the bottom right of the table.

From left to right, you can see:
- **The number of items per page**: by default, an 100 items maximum are displayed by page. You can also choose to display only 5, 10 or 25 items per page.
- **The displayed items and the total number of items**.
- **The navigation arrows**: travel from a page to another.
