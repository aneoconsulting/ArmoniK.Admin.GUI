To easily visualize and manipulate data, ArmoniK Admin GUI uses a datagrid. A datagrid is a table that displays data in rows and columns. It allows you to sort, filter paginated data.

Every data and compute is displayed in a datagrid.

Every datagrids have the same features:

- [Filtering](./datagrid-filtering.md)
- [Sorting](./datagrid-sorting.md)
- [Pagination](./datagrid-pagination.md)
- [Custom columns](./datagrid-custom-columns.md)
