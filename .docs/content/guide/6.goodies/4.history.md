# History

To help you to navigate, we have added a history feature. It allows you to go back to the previous pages you have visited directly from the GUI.

::alert{type="info"}
We try, as much as we can, to keep page state in the URL to allow you to share it with other users.

This is especially useful when you are navigating through the datagrid, using filters and sorting. It plays well with the [favorites](./favorites.md) feature.

Of course, you can also use the browser history and the back button.
