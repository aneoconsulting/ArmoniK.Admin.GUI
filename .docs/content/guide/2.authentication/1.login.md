# Login

When the application start, you are automatically login.

If authentication is not activated in your current deployment, you will be login as an `Anonymous` user. This will give you access to the entire application without restriction.

However, if authentication is activated, you will need to provide a certificate. Otherwise, you will not be able to access the application.

Refer to your system administrator to know if authentication is deployed.

Please see [ArmoniK docs](https://https://aneoconsulting.github.io/ArmoniK/) for more informations.
