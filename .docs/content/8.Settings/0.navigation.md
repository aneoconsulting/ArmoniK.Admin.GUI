# Navigation settings

You can modify the navigation bar in the left area of the settings page. It is composed of pages and dividers (visual separator).

In the settings, the navigation bar is displayed as a list of elements. Every one of them is composed of an icon, a name and an action.

- You can **drag the icon** to **update the order** of the navigation bar list.
- You can **click on the name** and **select a page** to directly change the page.
- You can **open the action menu** and **click on remove** the remove the current element from the list.

To **add a new page**, click on `+ Add a status` at the bottom of the list. Nothing prevents you from displaying the same page twice.

When you are **done modifying**, click on the `save` button to update the navigation bar.

If you want to reset to your last saved modification, click on `reset`. You can also reset to the default values by clicking on `Reset to default`.
