# Inspection Pages

Inspection pages are usefull when you want to display every information about a single item. They are available for [Partitions](./7.Data/2.Partitions.md), [Sessions](./7.Data/3.Sessions.md), [Tasks](./7.Data/4.Tasks.md) and [Results](./7.Data/5.Results.md).

The header contains various informations, from left to right :
- The **type** of data ([Sessions](./7.Data/3.Sessions.md), [Tasks](./7.Data/4.Tasks.md)...).
- The **ID** or **name** of the data (copy it with the square icon).
- The **status** of the data, if there is one.
- A **Share Page** button.

## Toolbar

Just like [Datagrids](./6.DataGrids/1.introduction.md), inspection pages have toolbars, providing actions and navigation options. Here is a quick look:

On those pages, data is not automatically refreshed, you have to do it manually with the `refresh` button.

Inspection pages generally come with the ability to **navigate** to other datagrid or inspection pages. These navigation button are located in the top left corner of the toolbar.

On some inspection pages, you will have the ability to interact with the data through **actions**. Those actions are located beneath the `refresh` button.

## Content

The content of an inspection page is mainly situated beneath the toolbar. You will find almost every field, except the data ID, its status, and its arrays.

Objects will be displayed by their name in a collapse area.

The [Custom](./6.DataGrids/3.columns.md#custom-columns) fields of a data can be found in the `Options->Options` collapsable object.

By **clicking on a ID**, you will be **redirected to the inspection page of this ID**. 

By clicking on the `See all` button, you will be **redirected to a filtered datagrid**.
